# Africa Adaptation Grey Literature Review — Scraper Pipeline

## What this project does
Systematic retrieval of grey literature (project evaluations, completion reports, funding proposals) from 20+ institutional sources for an evidence synthesis on climate adaptation in Africa's food and agriculture sector. Covers 2000–2025.

## Architecture
- One R script per institutional source (`worldbank.R`, `gcf.R`, `gef.R`, `afdb.R`, etc.)
- Shared config in `R/00_config.R` — paths, HTTP settings, African country lists, keyword lists
- Shared utilities in `R/01_utils.R` — HTTP helpers, download/log functions, relevance filters
- Each scraper follows the same pattern: **query → parse to tibble → filter → save metadata CSV → download PDFs → log**
- PDFs go to `downloads/{source_name}/`, metadata CSVs to `data/`, logs to `data/download_log.csv`
- Master runner: `R/run_all.R` (runs all scrapers sequentially with error isolation)

## The knowledge folder is part of the deliverable

`..\00_Knowledge\` is the shared memory of this workstream: twelve short
markdown files that let a person or an AI session start from where we are
now instead of reverse-engineering it from code.

**Keep it current in the same commit as the change.** A new script, a new
output file, a score that moved, a rule the pipeline now enforces, a
decision taken or a question raised: each has a home there, and the trigger
table in `00_Knowledge\README.md` says which file. `01_current_state.md` is
the only file allowed to carry live numbers, so update it there and nowhere
else. Move the `Last verified` date on anything you touch.

This is not documentation for its own sake. The folder is what makes the
work handoverable, and it rots in about a week if it is treated as a
separate chore.

## Git conventions
- Conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`
- One feature branch per new scraper: `feat/{source-name}`
- Commit to branch, push, then merge to main after testing
- Remote: https://github.com/Mlolita26/AI_grey_litterature

## Coding conventions
- Every scraper file starts with a header block (##########) documenting: source, URL, strategy, document types targeted, quirks
- All HTTP via `polite_get()` — never raw `httr::GET()`
- All requests use `HTTP_CONFIG$user_agent` and delays from `HTTP_CONFIG$delay_min/max`
- Never crash the pipeline — wrap everything in `tryCatch`, log failures, keep going
- Deduplication before downloading (by document ID or URL)
- PDF validation: check magic bytes `%PDF-` and file size > `HTTP_CONFIG$min_pdf_bytes`
- Metadata tibble minimum columns: `id`, `title`, `pdf_url`, `doc_date`, `doc_type`, `country`, `project_id`, `web_url`

## Key shared functions (R/01_utils.R)
| Function | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `safe_get_json(url)` | GET + JSON parse with retry |
| `polite_get(url)` | GET with delay + user-agent + exponential backoff |
| `safe_read_html(url)` | GET + HTML parse with JS-page detection |
| `download_pdf(url, dest)` | Download + validate PDF (magic bytes + size) |
| `log_download(source, project_code, doc_type, title, url, filepath, status, notes)` | Append to CSV log |
| `passes_relevance_fast(text, require_africa, require_sector)` | Keyword relevance check using pre-compiled regex |
| `safe_filename(x)` | Sanitize strings for filenames |
| `print_source_summary(source_name)` | Print log summary for a source |

## Source status
| Source | Script | Status | Strategy |
|--------|--------|--------|---------|
| World Bank | `worldbank.R` | ✅ Working | REST API (search.worldbank.org/api/v3/wds) |
| GCF | `gcf.R` | ✅ Working | Drupal AJAX scraping |
| GEF | `gef.R` | ✅ Working | HTML table scraping |
| AfDB | `afdb.R` | ✅ Working | Category listings on www.afdb.org (PCR/PCREN/PPER/agri evaluations) + IDEV faceted search (taxonomy discovered at runtime); per-host session cookies + browser headers defeat the WAF; modes: AFDB_MODE=probe/capped/load/full |
| IFAD | `ifad.R` | ✅ Built | IATI XML (registry API) → D-Portal fallback; www.ifad.org blocks scrapers (403) |
| Adaptation Fund | `af.R` | 🔲 Not started | TBD |
| FAO | `fao.R` | 🔲 Not started | TBD |
| UNDP | `undp.R` | 🔲 Not started | TBD |
| UNEP | `unep.R` | 🔲 Not started | TBD |
| WFP | `wfp.R` | 🔲 Not started | TBD |
| IFPRI | `ifpri.R` | 🔲 Not started | TBD |

## Building a new scraper — checklist
1. Research the source website (API?, pagination, filters, doc types) — document in script header
2. Create `R/{source}.R` following the worldbank.R/gcf.R pattern
3. Test: run the scraper, check metadata CSV, verify PDF downloads
4. Update the source status table in this CLAUDE.md
5. Commit on branch `feat/{source-name}`, push, merge to main
