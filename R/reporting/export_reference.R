#   reading_reference_locations   308 location rows, produced by reading the
#                                 ten gold PDFs rather than by the pipeline.
#                                 The human-analog benchmark.
#   lucy_gold_locations            60 location rows, extracted by hand (v02)
#   lucy_gold_general              10 project rows, extracted by hand (v02)
#
# Neither reference is beyond question - both have known errors, listed in
# scores\location_extraction_comparison_2026-09-09.md. They are targets to

'document' says which PDF the row came from.
