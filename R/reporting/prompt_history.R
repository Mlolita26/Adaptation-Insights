# prompt_history.R - every version of the extraction prompts, with the actual
# text, pulled out of git.
#
# Two sheets, nothing else:
#   read me         how to read it
#   prompt history  one row per version per prompt block: what was going
#                   wrong, what changed, whether the fix went in the prompt or
#                   in code, and the prompt itself
#
# The prompt text is not retyped here. It is read out of the scripts as they
# stood at the commit that introduced each version, so it cannot drift from
# what actually ran. The notes on what went wrong are curated, from the commit
# log and the score files.
