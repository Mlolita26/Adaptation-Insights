# screen_scope.R — decide whether a document belongs in the corpus at all,
# by READING IT, and record why against each protocol criterion.
#
# WHY THIS IS A SECOND SCRIPT, NOT AN EDIT TO screen_corpus.R.
# screen_corpus.R asks "does this document's cover agree with the folder we
# filed it in". It answers that from 3 pages, 8 documents per call, and that
# batching is exactly what makes it cheap. This script asks a different
# question — "should it be in the corpus" — and that cannot be answered from a
# cover page: on a World Bank ICR the first pages are a cover and a data
# sheet, while the climate risk the project responds to appears in the
# development objective or the context section. Reading whole documents means
# one document per call, so the two cannot share a loop. Both still have a
# job: this one is the gate, the older one stays useful as a periodic sweep
# for filing mistakes among documents already in scope.
#
# WHAT IT COSTS. Measured over 48 corpus documents: mean 55 pages, 136k
# characters. Whole corpus, whole documents, gpt-5-nano: about 21 M input
# tokens, USD 1.06. Reading only the first 3 pages would cost 6 cents. The
# difference is not worth optimising, so it reads everything.
#
# HOW IT DECIDES. The model weighs the protocol's criteria and returns ONE
# verdict and ONE sentence. When a document is out of scope that sentence must
# NAME the criteria that failed, so a reviewer can see the ground without
# opening the file. The year rule is applied afterwards in code, because it is
# still unsettled: the WP3 protocol says 2000-2025 and the workstream operates
# 2015-2025 (open question 12). Changing YEAR_MIN and YEAR_MAX below and
# re-running apply_verdict over the saved rows re-decides on dates with no
# document read again.
#
# Criteria, from WP3 protocol Tables 1-3:
#   scope       an African country is named as an implementation location
#   sector      crops, livestock, fisheries, agroforestry, food systems or
#               value chains are the PRIMARY subject, not incidental
#   intervention the project responds to an observed or anticipated CLIMATE
#               risk, and the response is adaptation rather than mitigation
#   source      the document reports IMPLEMENTED action (delivered outputs,
#               disbursement, monitoring indicators, evaluation findings),
#               not a plan, a proposal or an administrative note
#   timeframe   the document's own year falls in the accepted window
#
# Nothing is moved. Output is a review list, as screen_corpus.R is, so a
# person can correct it before anything acts on it.
