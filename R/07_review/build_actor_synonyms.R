# build_actor_synonyms.R - build catalogues/actor_synonyms.csv and enforce the
# one rule that makes it safe: a synonym points at exactly one institution.
#
# Two things feed the file:
#
#   MECHANICAL rows, derived here from what the registry already says. There
#   are fewer than you would expect, because the shared name comparison in
#   actor_names.R already folds British spelling, accents, bracketed acronyms
#   and spacing. What it cannot fold is a name that means something different
#   when shortened - "Ministry of Finance, Ghana" cut to "Ministry of Finance"
#   is a name several countries share - so those go through the uniqueness
#   rule here instead of into the normaliser.
#
#   REVIEWED rows, written by a person reading the organisation's own website,
#   carrying the URL and the quoted text as evidence.
#
# The rule, applied to every row whatever its source:
#
#   1. a synonym under 3 characters is dropped ("AA" is not an identifier)
#   2. a synonym two or more codes claim is demoted to `candidate`, where it
#      can only put a name in front of the confirmation step
#   3. a synonym equal to a different code's name or acronym is dropped
#   4. every drop is written down with its reason - nothing vanishes silently
#
# Rebuilding never overwrites: an existing row wins, a row a person wrote or
# reviewed is never touched, and the file is written to a temp name and moved
# into place so an interrupted run cannot leave half a file on OneDrive.
