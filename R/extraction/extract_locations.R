# extract_locations.R — SESSION 1 for the LOCATION-SPECIFIC template sheet
# (project_data_location-specific; protocol §5/§7 two-session design).
#
# Extracts, verbatim, one row per location x intervention (x result) from an
# evaluation PDF, plus an enumeration of every named intervention location.
# NO controlled-vocabulary choices here: subsector type, result_level,
# target_beneficiary category, location codes and the project_lead actor code
# are assigned afterwards in R/extraction/harmonize_locations.R.
#
# Carried over from extract_verbatim.R (v1.0 robustness):
#   page-tagged whole document, doc-first prompts (provider caching),
#   section maps for known big-document families, focus injection for
#   multi-project documents, results-framework pages attached as images,
#   mechanical fact-check of values/names against cited pages, junk gates.
#
# Usage:
#   Rscript R/extraction/extract_locations.R manifest.csv   # project_code,pdf,focus
#   Rscript R/extraction/extract_locations.R doc.pdf
#   EXTRACT_MODE=probe    -> locations group only (plumbing test)
#   EXTRACT_MODEL=...     -> model override (default gpt-5-mini)
#   EXTRACT_OUT_DIR=...   -> output folder (default outputs/extraction/locations)
# Requires OPENAI_API_KEY (~/.Renviron).
